Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

SOLUTION :
------------
string Solution::solve(string A) 
{
    int n=A.length();
    int i=n-1;
    string ans;
    while(i>=0)
    {
        while(i>=0 and A[i]==' ')i--;
        int j=i;
        if(i<0)break;
        while(i>=0 and A[i]!=' ')i--;
        if(ans.length()==0)ans=A.substr(i+1,j-i);
        else ans=ans+" "+A.substr(i+1,j-i);


    }   
    return ans;
}
